MORE INFO
=========
The Sauerbraten sources are very small, compact, and non-redundant, so anyone
wishing to modify the source code should be able to gain an overview of
Sauerbraten's inner workings by simply reading through the source code in its
entirety. Small amounts of comments should guide you through the more
tricky sections.

When reading the source code and trying to understand Sauerbaten's internal design,
keep in mind the goal of Cube: minimalism. I wanted to create a very complete
game / game engine with absolutely minimal means, and made a sport out of it
keeping the implementation small and simple. Sauerbraten is not a commercial 
product, it is merely the author's idea of a fun little programming project.
